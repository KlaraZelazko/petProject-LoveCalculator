# 💘 Love Calculator (Self-Taught Project)

Learning project based on a YouTube tutorial.  
I followed the tutorial to understand the basics, then enhanced the project independently by adding animations, custom messages, and styling.

A fully functional web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Generates a random “love compatibility” percentage between two names with a smooth animated counter.
